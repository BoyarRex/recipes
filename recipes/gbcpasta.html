        <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>A relatively easy and delicious pasta recipe.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>6oz spaghetti.</li>
                <li>2 Tablespoons butter, divided.</li>
                <li>4 garlic cloves, minced.</li>
                <li>1/4 cup white wine.</li>
                <li>1 cup chicken broth.</li>
                <li>2 Tablespoons capers.</li>
                <li>Juice of 1/2 a lemon.</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><p>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil then add spaghetti and cook until just al dente - it will continue cooking a bit in the garlic butter caper sauce. Drain then set aside.</p></li>
                <li><p>Meanwhile, melt 1 Tablespoon butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat then add garlic and saute until golden brown. Add wine then simmer until reduced by half. Add chicken broth, lemon juice, and capers then turn heat up to high and simmer until sauce is reduced by half. Add remaining Tablespoon butter then taste and add salt if necessary.</p></li>
                <li><p>Remove skillet from heat then add cooked pasta and stir to combine. Let sit for 3-4 minutes to let sauce adhere to pasta - it will thicken up as the pasta cools. Serve with fresh chopped herbs and a crack of black pepper for garnish, if desired.</p></li>
            </ol>
